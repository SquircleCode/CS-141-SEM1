2. A salary of Rs7.00 per hour plus a 10% commission on sales; (Assume you work 40 hours a week)
3. No salary, but 20% commissions and Rs20 for each pair of shoes sold
Write a program to help decide the best choice of compensation.
You ask the user for input (Write a function for this).
Then write other functions for each of the options.
Write a driver program to use the 4 functions and decide the best option for yourself.
(Of course, the weekly sales - the number of shoes sold per week has to be given by the user)

// input function
	//question out
	//answer in
	//return value - weekly sales ( number of shoes sold per week )

// fixed salary
	//just stays 600 no matter what

// salary + commission
	//input - sales
	// salary (sal) = 7 rs/hr
	// working hrs (wh) = 40
	// tot_sal = sal x wh
	// comm = 10%
	// tot_comm = comm * sales
	// money_earned = tot_sal + tot_comm
	//output - money_earned
 
// no salary, only commission
	// input - weekly_sales, sales
	//tot_ValComm = 0.2 * sales
	//tot_NumComm = 20 * weekly_sales
	//money_earned = tot_comm + tot_NumComm
	// output - money_earned

// largest number finder
	// input - 3 numbers
	// find largest one
	// output - largest numberof the 3
