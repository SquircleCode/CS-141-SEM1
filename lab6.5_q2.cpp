// input function
	//question out
	//answer in
	//return value - weekly sales - number of shoes sold per week

// fixed salary
	//just stays 600 no matter what

// salary + commission
	// salary (sal) = 7 rs/hr
	// working hrs (wh) = 40
	// tot_sal = sal x wh
	// comm = 10%
	// sales = 225 * weekly sales
	// tot_comm = comm * sales
	// money earned = tot_sal + tot_comm

// no salary, only commission
