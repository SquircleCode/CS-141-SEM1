1. Write a program to find sum of all elements of an array. (Use functions)
2. Write a program to find the largest, smallest, mean, median, elements with highest frequency of the elements of all elements of an array. (Use functions for each of the task in the question)
3. Write a program for kth largest, kth smallest element of an array. (Use functions : e.g. klarge (int array[], int size, int k), similarly for smallest)
4. Write a program to merge 2 arrays (just one after another into another array), find maximum of 2 arrays [maximum element of all the elements in both the arrays], find minimum of 2 arrays [similar to maximum]. (Use functions for each)
